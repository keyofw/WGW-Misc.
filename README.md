# WGW-Misc.

Hey everyone,
I've set up this repository for any WGW-related things we do that aren't connected to a specific project we're working on.
Things it is good for:

Prototypes
Random Design Docs
Pictures of Cats
Thoughts or ideas that are too large for standard communication
More Pictures of Cats
Write-ups of Meetings or Discussions

Things it is not good for:
Anything about a game we're actively working on
Business-related things like copies of contracts
Little notes that could easily be shared on FB

Feel free to add things at your leisure
Please let people know when you've done stuff. Chances are, given our current work environment, we will immediately forget this
exists unless people use it and remind each other to check it out.

Michael
