# WGW-Misc.

Hey everyone, I've set up this repository for any WGW-related things we do that aren't connected to a specific project we're working on.

Things it is good for:

Prototypes, random design docs, pictures of cats, thoughts or ideas that are too large for standard communication, more pictures of cats, write-ups of meetings or discussions

Things it is not good for:

Anything about a game we're actively working on, business-related things like copies of contracts, little notes that could easily be shared on FB

Feel free to add things at your leisure. Please let people know when you've done stuff. Chances are, given our current work environment, we will immediately forget this exists unless people use it and remind each other to check it out.

Michael
